# ShinoPy
This is a port of the 1987 Sega Arcade Game Shinobi.
It uses a small python lib called GenePy, based upon Pygame, whose purpose is to mimic some aspects of the Megadrive hardware, in order to make a port to the Megadrive easier. The goal of this project is to design a proper game engne, before working on the Megadrive version (which will use SGDK).

For this reason, the engine is volontarily not optimized.

The project is in very early alpha, as the GenePy library.
